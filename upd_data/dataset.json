The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock, used for seed, put to manufacture for food use and non-food uses, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per caput supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking of it. Data on per caput food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and - by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products - also in terms of caloric value and protein and fat content.",

        "DatasetDescription": "The FAOSTAT monthly Food CPI and General CPI database was based on the ILO CPI data until December 2014. In 2014, IMF-ILO-FAO agreed to transfer global CPI data compilation from ILO to IMF. Upon agreement, CPIs for all items and its sub components originates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the UN Statistics Division(UNSD) for countries not covered by the IMF. However, due to a limited time coverage from IMF and UNSD for a number of countries, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Central Bank of Western African States (BCEAO), Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), UNdata, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and national statistical office website data are used for missing historical data from IMF and UNSD food CPI. The FAO CPI dataset for all items(or general CPI) and the Food CPI, consists of a complete and consistent set of time series from January 2000 onwards. Data gaps on monthly Food CPI and General CPI are filled using statistical estimation procedures to have full data coverage for all countries for Food CPI and for General CPI. These indices measure the price change between the current and reference periods of the average basket of goods and services purchased by households. The General CPI is typically used to measure and monitor inflation, set monetary policy targets, index social benefits such as pensions and unemployment benefits, and to escalate thresholds and credits in the income tax systems and wages in public and private wage contracts. The FAOSTAT monthly Food CPI inflation rates are annual year-over-year inflation or percentage change over corresponding month of the previous year. The regional and sub-regional Food and General CPI, and the aggregated Food and General CPI at the different income levels (High-income economies, Low-income economies, Lower-middle-income economies and Upper-middle-income economies) are calculated using 2 different statistical methods:- A weighted average of food and general CPI values of countries and territories within each region using the weights of  Household final consumption expenditure (including non-profit institutions serving households) in  2015 in USD at constant prices of 2015. Household final consumption expenditure is available at https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama.- Median of food and general CPI values of countries and territories within each region.",

        "DatasetDescription": "As part of the FAO Agriculture Capital Stock (ACS) database, ESS-FAO publishes country-by-country data on physical investment in agriculture, forestry and fishing as measured by the System of National Accounts (SNA) concept of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Additional variables included in the ACS are Net and Gross Capital Stock, Consumption of Fixed Capital, the Agriculture Investment ratio, and the Gross Fixed Capital Formation Agriculture Orientation Index. The FAO Agriculture Capital Stock Database is an analytical database: whenever available, the database integrates official National Accounts data harvested from the UNSD National Accounts Main Aggregates Database (UNSD AMA) and the OECD Annual National Accounts Database (OECD ANA). The database is further supplemented by OECD Structural Analysis database (OECD STAN) and in a few countries data from the country’s statistics website. If the full set of official data is not available for any specific country, imputation methods are applied to obtain estimates over the complete time series. Many data points in ACS are estimated and are flagged as such; they do not represent official Member countries' submissions. With a view of producing internationally comparable net capital stock estimates, we employ the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) with a time invariant geometric depreciation rate to impute missing data. The Perpetual Inventory Method is a well-established economic model to calculate Net Capital Stocks (NCS) and Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC) from time series of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Specifically, annual measures of the NCS are obtained from cumulating historical series on physical investment flows and deducting the part of assets that are depreciated (the Consumption of Fixed Capital that occurs in every period). In order to implement the PIM, long time series on aggregate GFCF in agriculture, forestry and fishing is required. As much as possible, we rely on National Accounts data published by the OECD and UNSD. When country data are partially or fully missing, we employ econometric techniques to impute missing observations. Depending on the pattern of data missingness for the countries, different imputation methods are applied (selected from the ARMAX, PANEL and OLS classes of econometric models) for the data series from 1995 to 2021.The values of Agriculture Capital Stock related indicators for 2022, including Agriculture Investment Ratio, Agriculture Orientation Index, Net Capital Stock, Gross Fixed Capital Formation and Consumption of Fixed Capital, are estimated using the Holt-Winters (HW) method (Cipra et al., 1995). The HW method is an exponential smoothing method for forecasting the annual values of economic variables. In this context, the HW method relies on existing (historical) values of the Agriculture Capital Stock. The predicted value is an extrapolation of the historical values to the specified target date, which extends the timeline without considering seasonality in the annual series.All data series in the database are provided both in national currencies and in US dollars as well as in current prices and constant prices with base year 2015. Calculation of constant price series is done applying GFCF deflator series. When OECD National Accounts data are available, an OECD implicit deflator for agriculture GFCF is calculated and used. For other cases, the implicit deflators on GFCF for total economy available from the FAOSTAT Deflators database is used.",

The three food value measures differ for the bundle of goods and services they account for. In particular, the FAH refers to domestic expenditures of personal consumption for food consumed at home, at purchaser prices. The FTAH measure is similar in its target, but it refers to a broader set of economic goods, inclusive of tobacco, as food and tobacco expenditures are not always separable in the original data. On the other side, the FAAFH refers to domestic expenditures of personal consumption for food consumed away from home (e.g. in restaurants), at purchaser prices, and it also includes expenditures for accommodation in all the cases where the two types of expenditures were not separable in the original data. The values of industry decomposition measure the food production value-added distribution across different industries and factors involved in the agri-food value chain.

        "DatasetDescription": "The FAOSTAT domain Fires consists of estimates of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from biomass burning in a range of vegetation types and from fires in organic soils. Data are computed geospatially using Tier 1 default factors of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National greenhouse gas (GHG) Inventories and of the Supplement on Wetlands (IPCC, 2006; 2014) for the organic soils component. Estimates are available by country and with global coverage, in complete time series for the period 1990–2021. The database is updated annually.  The FAOSTAT domain Fires disseminates information by country on: activity data (in hectares of burned area and tonnes of burned biomass); and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in kilotonnes of N2O, CH4 and CO2). Data are available for all countries and territories, for standard FAOSTAT regional aggregations, and for Annex I and non-Annex I country groups.  The uncertainties in FAOSTAT estimates of emissions from fires in organic soils area very high (IPCC, 2014). FAOSTAT estimates rely on remotely sensed data of burning biomass in areas where organic soils are also mapped. On the one hand, the presence of fires may not always be a signal that the underlying peat layer is burning.  On the other hand, remote sensing information has limited capacity to detect the smoldering fires that are typical of peatlands.  Furthermore, the methods applied herein do not distinguish between fires on drained and undrained organic soils, rather assuming burning of the organic layer in both cases. Existing literature and country reports support FAOSTAT country estimates in South East Asia (e.g. Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam), where burning of the organic layer is associated with deforestation fires and drainage. In all other countries, absence of literature and lack of other evidence suggest that FAOSTAT emissions data from fires in organic soils should be used with caution, as a tool to investigate possible national hotspots, rather than for evaluating national GHG inventory data. There is insufficient information to date to confirm the actual presence, quantity and causes (i.e. human-induced vs wildfires) of fires in organic soils outside Southeastern Asia.  This FAOSTAT domain also disseminates the activity data and emissions data reported by countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on fire disturbance for a range of vegetation types in Forest Land and Grassland and from fires in organic soils. Activity data are sourced from the most recently available GHG National Inventories (NGHGI) or from National Communications. Emission data are sourced directly from the UNFCCC data portal or from Biennial Update Reports (BURs). UNFCCC data are disseminated in FAOSTAT with permission, formalized via a FAO-UNFCCC Memorandum of Understanding.   The IPCC recommends the use of the FAOSTAT database to countries as a tool for NGHGI QA/QC processes and validation of both activity data and emissions estimates (IPCC, 2019).",

Data are computed following the Tier 1 methods of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National greenhouse gas (GHG) Inventories(IPCC, 1996; 1997; 2000; 2002; 2006; 2014). Emissions from other economic sectors as defined by the IPCC are also disseminated in the domain for completeness. The domain includes methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from all the above activities as well as the aggregate fluorinated gases (F-gases) emissions used in industrial processes. Estimates are available by country, with global coverage for the period 1961–2020 with projections for 2030 and 2050 for some categories of emissions or 1990–2020 for others. The database is updated annually  The FAOSTAT domain Emissions Totals disseminates information estimates for the single gases and their aggregates in CO2eq in units of kilotonnes (kt or 10*6 kg). The latter are computed by using the IPCC Fifth Assessment report global warming potentials, AR5 (IPCC, 2014).   Emissions from agrifood systems are those generated within farm gate, those associated with the land use change and the emissions from pre- and post-production food processes. The latter emissions are calculated based on data from the UN Statistical Division (UNSD), the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other third-party as well as by integrating emission information from the PRIMAP-hist dataset v2.4 (Gütschow et al., 2022). Methodologies for these estimates are described in dedicated working papers as follows: I) food transport; II) food systems waste disposal and III) fertilizers manufacturing, food processing, retail, packaging and household consumption. It should be noted that, the world aggregate estimates of food transport also includes international bunkers related to food. Emissions from “International Bunkers” is derived from data on ‘International aviation’ and ‘International navigation/shipping’ of the EDGARv6.0 dataset (JRC/PBL, 2019), covering the period 1990–2018 and extrapolated linearly to 2020 by FAOSTAT Domain Emissions Totals. Emissions for this category are only available for the world aggregate.  PRIMAP data for other IPCC sectors is also disseminated for completeness and in view of computing shares of emissions for the whole economy (these are disseminate separately in the FAOSTAT domain Emissions shares). The IPCC economic sectors are: energy, industrial processes and product use (IPPU), waste and other n.e.c. These data are sourced from the PRIMAP-hist v2.4 dataset (Gütschow et al., 2022).Emissions Totals jointly disseminates the emissions reported by countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Emission data are sourced directly from the UNFCCC data portal as submitted by countries through their most recent GHG National Inventories (NGHGI) or are extracted from Biennial Update Reports (BURs).UNFCCC data are disseminated in FAOSTAT with permission, formalized via a FAO-UNFCCC Memorandum of Understanding. Values for Annex I and non-Annex I groups are computed from the UNFCCC data for the single categories of emissions listed in Table 1 and for IPCC Agriculture aggregate. It should be noted that due to incomplete reporting, significant data gaps characterize the non-Annex I aggregates.",

The dataset also provides statistics on the total credit to all industries, indicators on the share of credit to agricultural producers, and an agriculture orientation index (AOI) for credit that normalizes the share of credit to agriculture over total credit by dividing it by the share of agriculture in gross domestic product (GDP). As such, it can provide a more accurate indication of the relative importance that banking sectors place on financing the sector. An AOI lower than 1 indicates that the agriculture sector receives a credit share lower than its contribution to the economy, while an AOI greater than 1 indicates a credit share to the agriculture sector greater than its economic contribution.",

The IMF is the responsible institution for the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) methodology and annually collects GFS data, including Expenditure by Functions of Government (COFOG). The Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) is an international classification developed by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and published by the United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD), with the aim of categorise governments' functions according to their purposes. The FAO questionnaire aligns with Table 7 of the IMF GFS questionnaire, replicates the relevant aggregates and drills down to request additional detail related to Agriculture. The FAO dataset consists of a time series, from 2001 onwards, of Total Government Expenditure and expenditure in: Economic affairs; Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, along with its three disaggregated subsectors of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing; and Environmental Protection. In addition, expenditure in each detailed function are further disaggregated into Recurrent and Capital expenditure. Additional indicators include the Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure, and the Agriculture Orientation Index (ratio between the Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure and the Agriculture Value Added as Share of GDP). Imputation methods were used to provide a complete and consistent global dataset as some challenges arise with different stages of implementation of the GFS methodology and COFOG classification, and differences in the data collection and reporting at country level. Data are reported for the highest level of government available (Consolidated general government, consolidated central government or budgetary central government) and are available for about 100 countries on a regular basis. In some cases (for example, India and Pakistan), data may reflect the general government sector as per national norm. That is, budgetary central government combined with state government.",

In order to ensure that sub-industry series are consistent in levels with National Accounts based series, which is needed to support comparability across industries (agriculture vs. agro-industry and sub-industries), we proceed to a rescaling exercise of UNIDO originating series on UNSD National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates data series (See Section 20 for a more detailed description of the data processing steps).",

The indicators published in FAOSTAT are derived from the labour force statistics (LFS) and rural and urban labour markets (RURURB) databases of the ILOSTAT database. In addition, the ILO modelled estimates and projections (ILOEST) are used to provide information on employment in agriculture. As of July 2024, FAOSTAT disseminates five new indicators on employment in agrifood systems (AFS) for the period 2000–2021 at the country, regional and global levels using a methodology developed by FAO to estimate the number of people employed in agrifood systems. The indicators on rural areas provide information on the overall employment in rural areas, status in employment, and labour force participation by sex and age whenever possible.",

It is obtained by dividing a current price value of a given aggregate by its real counterpart.  When calculated from the major national accounting aggregates such as GDP or agriculture value added, implicit price deflators pertains to wider ranges of goods and services in the economy than that represented by any of the individual price indexes (such as CPIs, PPIs). Movements in an implicit price deflator reflect both changes in price and changes in the composition of the aggregate for which the deflator is calculated.In the FAOSTAT Deflators database, all series are derived from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) National Accounts Analysis of Main Aggregates database (UNSD AMA).  In particular, the implicit GDP deflator, the implicit GFCF deflator, the implicit value added deflator of Agriculture, Forestry, Fishery and the implicit value added deflator of Manufacturing are obtained by dividing the series in current prices by those in constant 2015 prices (base year).",

        "DatasetDescription": "The dataset presents average daily per capita macro and micro nutrient availability by country and by FAO/WHO GIFT food groups (that are different from those used for the Food Balance Sheets), expressed in grams/milligrams/micrograms/kcal per capita per day. The population numbers used to calculate these statistics can be found in the Supply Utilization Accounts (SUA) dataset of FAOSTAT, as Total Population. Food availability quantities are derived from the SUA dataset. SUAs present a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply and utilization during a specified reference period. The SUA shows for each food item - i.e. each primary commodity and a number of processed commodities potentially available for human consumption - the sources of supply and its utilization. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock, used for seed, put to manufacture for food use and non-food uses, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking of it.",

        "DatasetDescription": "Data from censuses of agriculture are collected at holding level and provide information about the structure of agriculture of a country or a territory (e.g. size and number of holdings, land tenure, legal status, and holder gender). An agricultural holding is an economic unit of agricultural production under single management comprising all livestock kept and all land used wholly or partly for agricultural production purposes. Member countries provided census data to FAO under the World Programme for the Census of Agriculture (WCA). National censuses are conducted at least once every ten years in an internationally comparable way. The ‘’Structural data from agricultural censuses’’ domain in FAOSTAT provides structural data from the last four WCA rounds (WCA 2020, 2010, 2000 and 1990) for each participating country and territory, to the extent possible. For earlier rounds (WCA 1930, 1950, 1960, 1970 and 1980) data are provided mainly on the number and area of holdings. The data are prepared based on the national census reports, later disseminated by FAO through the publications SDS 17, SDS 12 and SDS 9 and 9a, and recent methodological review of the available country census data of WCA 2020 round [Please explain the last sentence after 9a].",
